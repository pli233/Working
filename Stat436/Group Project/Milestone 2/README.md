## Introduction

In Milestone 1, we explored the significant contributions and economic impacts of international students on the American higher education system. Building upon this foundation, Milestone 2 delves deeper into the data of international students from the perspective of educational institutions, aiming to transform static datasets into dynamic visual narratives. These narratives are designed to aid educational institutions in developing sophisticated student engagement and recruitment strategies.

## ShinyIO Deployment

Explore our visualizations and findings at our Shiny web application: [Shiny App](https://pli233.shinyapps.io/Milestone2/)

## Source Code

Our work Project [Milestone2_Shiny.R](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pli233/Working/main/Stat436/Group%20Project/Milestone2/Project%20Milestone2_Shiny.R), including data processing and visualization codes, is available at: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pli233/Working/tree/main/Stat436/Group%20Project/Milestone2)

## Design Prototypes

### Prototype 1: Pie Chart for Source of Fund
- Showcases the distribution of various funding sources for international students, offering insights into the economic aspects of their educational journeys.

### Prototype 2: Choropleth Map for Student Origin
- Provides a geographical overview of student origins, highlighting the global dynamics of international education through color gradients.

### Prototype 3: Treemap for Field of Study
- Represents the popularity of different fields of study among international students, facilitating easy comparison and recognition through a colorful mosaic.

## Implementation 

We employed R for data preprocessing and visualization, utilizing the Shiny framework for interactive web application development. Our application encourages exploration through dynamic visualizations that respond to user inputs, enhancing the user experience by merging analytical depth with intuitive interfaces.
